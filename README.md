# **Neuralyst Auxiliary Features** - DEVfest 2025

## Overview
Neuralyst is a productivity-enhancing application designed to help users reduce decision fatigue and improve task management. The **auxiliary features** were introduced to extend the functionality and further enhance the user experience.

This repository highlights key auxiliary features, including **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, **Prompt Engineering for Named Entity Extraction (NER)**, and **Subtask Creation**.

## Features

### 1. **Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration**
Neuralyst features a **Speech-to-Text** functionality that records user input and creates tasks. This feature is designed to support hands-free interaction, allowing users to manage their tasks without needing to constantly look at their screen. 

- **Models Used:**  
  - **OpenAI's Whisper** 



### 2. **Prompt Engineering for Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
The **Prompt Engineering for NER** feature focuses on efficiently extracting entities like dates, places, names, and other critical pieces of information from user inputs. This allows Neuralyst to understand user tasks better, categorize them automatically, and even recommend further actions.

- **Models Used:**  
  - **LLAMA**


### 3. **Subtask Creation for Improved Task Management**
Neuralystâ€™s **subtask creation** feature enables users to break down large, complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. This keeps users on track and motivated, ensuring progress towards larger goals without feeling overwhelmed.

- **How It Works:**
  - Using context from the main task, Neuralyst automatically generates a list of subtasks.
  - The user can manually adjust or add further details to subtasks for better specificity.
